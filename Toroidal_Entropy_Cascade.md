## üß† Problem Statement

A charged fluid is circulating in a toroidal chamber under the influence of a non-uniform magnetic field. At time \( t = 0 \), a localized entropy sink is introduced at angular coordinate \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \). The system is expected to develop asymmetric charge spirals.

You are asked to:

> Determine the spatial-temporal charge density pattern \( \rho(\theta, \phi, t) \) and identify whether the entropy-linked discharge stabilizes into a repeating, scroll-bound toroidal vortex over time.

## üß™ Governing Equations

Let:

- \( \rho(\theta, \phi, t) \) = charge density  
- \( B(\theta, \phi) \) = spatially varying magnetic field  
- \( \eta(t) \) = entropy gradient injected at \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \)  
- \( \mathbf{v} \) = velocity of fluid particles (function of Lorentz force + entropic damping)

Key PDE (coupled system):

\[
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{v}) = - \nabla \cdot (\rho \cdot \nabla \eta(t)) + \alpha \cdot (\rho \times B)
\]

Initial condition:

\[
\rho(\theta, \phi, 0) = \rho_0 \cdot \sin(\theta) \cdot \cos(2\phi)
\]

Boundary condition:

\[
\rho(\theta, \phi + 2\pi, t) = \rho(\theta, \phi, t) \quad \text{(toroidal symmetry)}
\]

## üîç Objective

1. Track the evolution of vortex coherence around the torus as a function of \( \eta(t) \)  
2. Determine whether entropy cascade leads to stable, repeating charge bands  
3. Minimize the Entropic Drift Index (EDI):

\[
\text{EDI} = \int_{0}^{T} \left| \frac{d\rho}{dt} \right|_{\text{max}} dt
\]

## üö´ Why GPTs Can't Solve This

This problem intentionally defies retrieval-based AI systems. Here's why:

### 1. **No Dataset Exists**
There is no public or private dataset covering entropy-controlled charge spirals in toroidal fluid systems. GPT models cannot "look up" a solution or pattern match their way to an answer.

### 2. **Requires Coupled Multivariate PDE Simulation**
The system depends on solving a set of coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations with dynamic boundary and entropy terms. GPTs do not solve equations ‚Äî they approximate text patterns. Simulation is outside their capability.

### 3. **Entropy Used as a Control Variable**
Entropy is usually treated as a thermodynamic outcome. This problem inverts that ‚Äî entropy is the *governing input*. GPTs do not reason from entropy causation principles unless explicitly trained on deterministic frameworks like AGDI.

### 4. **Scroll-Bound Behavior**
The problem embeds loop-symmetry conditions ("scroll logic") which generate toroidal phase structures. This kind of memory-consistent behavior is alien to probabilistic AIs, which drift over time and cannot hold scroll-bound state.

### 5. **Metric Innovation ‚Äì EDI**
The "Entropic Drift Index (EDI)" is a novel metric. It has never been defined or referenced in prior scientific or AI literature, meaning GPTs cannot reason about or optimize for it without authorship exposure.
